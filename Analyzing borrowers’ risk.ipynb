    "- In order to prevent data duplication Bank should improve its data storage system: use clients' IDs and return to a user system error, when he/she enters negative values to the rows where it is not acceptable: income, days employed, age, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- As was found, the highest default rate of debt has an unmarried category of clients. To improve this situation the Bank could add a condition to its loan agreement for such category: to have a guarantor for expensive purchases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- With regards to the different types of purpose and their correlation to the debt, I found that 'buying a car' and 'education' have a less reliable rating, comparing to other purposes. It could happen due to the fact that education takes a long time to pay back. Sometimes finding a new job with a high salary takes longer than the loan deadlines.\n",
    "Car is a that type of expense, which didn't bring investments back. Unlike real estate, education, or property.  And people tend to overestimate their creditworthiness in the pursuit of comfort. In order to improve the credit payback system for this category of clients Bank should create a step-by-step procedure for assessing customer creditworthiness. Evaluate the thresholds on amounts per client, depending on the assessment of a group of factors, such as years of employment, average income per last year, availability of deposits in the Bank, additional income, marital status, credit history, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- There's up to 2% difference in debt_default rate between clients who have children and clients who don't. Clients who don't have children are more likely to return money to the Bank. It dosen't mean that Bank should reject on loans to clients with children. It only proves, that during creditworthiness eveluation process, Bank should add more steps. For example, check if second parent (if any) has good credit history or other factors confirming his solvency.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clients with average levels of income have the lowest credibility, default rate = 8.6%, clients with low income have a bit better default rate = 8.1%, and the most trustworthiness clients with high-income level = 7.2%.  The explanation for this is that people with average income tend to buy more expensive things that they can afford: buying houses, cars, getting prestigious educations. In order to improve credit rating for clients with average income, Bank should check whether the client has credits in other banks, his/her credit history, and have a threshold for a loan, which could be calculated as a % of annual income."
